# Simple Social Share Bar
A very basic HTML5 social share bar. 
It is useful if you want to avoid social media tracking and cookies loading on your website. 
(I'm still working on this repos as I wrote the script for the College News Section and relies on CSS on that website so the repos needs a little work to be useable - I'll update it when I have a spare moment!)
## Requirements
Coming Soon...

## ChangeLog:
- (09/07/2020) - Added to Git (repos does not work out of the box just yet)
